# Project Proposal

## Team Members

- Tristan Miranda

## Client: Jon Howell

## App Idea

Pound the Pirates takes most of its core features from the game Whac-A-Mole. The basic gameplay loop is to wait for a chest to pop open, and hit it with a hammer if it contains a pirate. The secondary components include a free cosmetic shop, in-game currency earned by playing the game, and a leaderboard to show the top scores.

## Target Audience

There has been no target audience for this app given, so it is assumed that the project will appeal to G (General) audiences. There will be no mention of sensitive topics beyond comical references such as “Booty” being treasure.

## Goals and Vision

The client desires a game that is somewhat addicting and is playable by general audiences. Somewhat whimsical in nature, the game should not involve any micro-transactions. The game should also not include recurring costs on the client, as this should be a one-time payment at most.

## Key Features

- Whac-A-Mole gameplay loop
- Booty (free in-game currency)
- Cosmetic shop / Customization
- Leaderboard (Centralized in the Google or Apple stores)

## Success Criteria

There was no success criteria given, it is assumed that publishing is considered a success, despite any attention the game garners.

## Technical Requirements

- Mobile game (Primary Android, secondary Apple)
- Touchscreen support
- Audio
- Visual
